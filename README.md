# Momentum

**Momentum** is a cutting-edge 3D endless runner game designed as a research project for the MSc in Artificial Intelligence at King’s College London under the project supervision of Profession Michael Cook. Momentum uses advanced procedural content generation (PCG) and real-time AI agent evaluation to ensure every playthrough is unique, challenging, and technically robust. Developed in Unity 6 and C#, the game is a testbed for new approaches in PCG, automated playtesting, and runtime validation of game levels.

## 📖 About the Project

Procedural generation has transformed how game worlds are built. In “Momentum,” content is not handcrafted, but generated by algorithms that blend randomness with strict evaluation to keep gameplay fair and interesting. The project tackles the dual challenge of generating **diverse, replayable levels** on-the-fly while ensuring that those levels are always **solvable, non-repetitive, and technically sound**.

Momentum’s core is built around:
- **Procedural terrain/object generation** via Wave Function Collapse
- **AI-based runtime evaluation** using automated agents and ray-casting
- **A feedback loop** that adapts game difficulty and reports “impossible” scenarios along with option to prevent them
- **A modular architecture** that allows easy tweaking and academic experimentation

Whether you are a player, a developer, or a researcher, “Momentum” is an exploration of the future of dynamic content in games.

## 🧩 How It Works: Procedural Generation & Evaluation

### Procedural Generation Pipeline
1. **Ground tiles** are spawned continuously as the player moves forward.
2. **Obstacles/objects** are placed using a 1D wave function collapse algorithm - no two tile objects are the same.
3. **NavMesh** is updated asynchronously to support agent navigation and avoid lags.

### Real-time Evaluation
- **Flying agent** runs ahead of the player, validating that a clear path exists.
- **Ray-casting** is used to check ground presence, obstacle spacing, and safety.
- If an unsolvable segment is detected, the generation algorithm rectifies it before the player arrives if the feature is active using flag.

### Clean-up & Optimization
- Tiles and objects are despawned automatically once the player passes, ensuring memory efficiency.
- NavMesh baking and agent validation run asynchronously for smooth gameplay.

## 🎮 Gameplay & Controls

### Controls
- **W** – Move forward
- **A/D** – Move left/right
- **Space** – Jump
- **In-game Sliders/UI** – Adjust speed, spawn rates, difficulty, etc.

### Game Objective
- Survive as long as possible by navigating the ever-changing, procedurally-generated landscape.
- Avoid obstacles and maximize your score, which is based on distance covered (Z-axis progression).

### UI & Feedback
- Real-time score display
- On-screen sliders for tuning game parameters live
- Crash/failure messages if generation fails (rare)

## 🏁 Installation & Running the Game

### Quick Start

1. **Download** the latest Windows build (`Momentum.zip`) from [Releases](#).
2. **Extract** the ZIP file to a folder of your choice.
3. **Run** `Momentum.exe` inside the extracted folder.

That’s it—no other setup or dependencies required.

### System Requirements

- Windows 10 or above (64-bit)
- 4GB+ RAM recommended
- Integrated or discrete GPU
- No Unity installation required

### Troubleshooting

- **Game won’t launch:**  
  Ensure that the system meets the requirements and the antivirus isn’t blocking the .exe. Run in administrator mode.
- **Low FPS or lag:**  
  Close other intensive applications. Lower display resolution if possible.
- **Missing DLL errors:**  
  Make sure all files from the ZIP are extracted. Do not run directly from inside the ZIP.

## 🧑‍🎓 Research & Academic Context

Momentum is a research-driven project investigating:
- How procedural generation can be made both flexible and robust for commercial-quality games
- New techniques for automated runtime validation of PCG content (using agents, ray-casting, etc.)
- The intersection of AI, game design, and player experience

This work was submitted as part of the MSc Individual Project for the Department of Informatics, King’s College London (2024/25).
